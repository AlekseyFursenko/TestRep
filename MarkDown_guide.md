# Marcdown Syntax
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.


# Heading level 1


## Heading level 2


### Heading level 3


#### Heading level 4


Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

Heading level 1

Heading level 2

Paragraphs
---

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

Line Breaks
--------

To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

For compatibility, use trailing white space or the <br> HTML tag at the end of the line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.

Bold
---

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

I just love **bold text**.

I just love __bold text__.

## Git init

* *git init* - turns any directory into a Git repository.

### Common usages and options for 'git init'

* *git init* - Transform the current directory into a Git repository

* *git init  <directory>* - Transform a directory in the current path into a Git repository

* *git init --bare* - Create a new bare repository (a repository to be used as a remote repository only, that won't contain active development)

You can see all of the options with git init in [git-scm's documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)

## Git add

* *git add* - command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.

*git add* is an important command - without it, no *git commit* would ever do anything. Sometimes, *git add* can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in development. But in reality, *git add* is an important and powerful tool. *git add* allows you to shape history without changing how you work.
